For q1:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_football_clubs_in_Italy
	seems not useful
	Another approach: Category:Football_venues_in_Italy
	Our approach: football clubs in italy --> stadiums used by the clubs --> the capacities of the stadiums

For q6,7,8:
	Do we assume that prefixes can be repeated? overriden throughout the file? 
	How do I know which type is the value, from the file? eg. if is int for population
		How to distinguish those types??? --> w/o quotes?
	Do we assume that all delimator/seperator is fixed? eg: ' ,   '

	Everything need to be stored:
		every node, along with its prefix and data type
		every prefix defination
		every rdf statement
