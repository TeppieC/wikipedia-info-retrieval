Since we have only one table with 4 columns: ID, subject, predicate, object.

CREATE INDEX index_subject ON statement (subject)
CREATE INDEX index_predicate ON statement (predicate)
CREATE INDEX index_object ON statement (object)
CREATE INDEX index_subject_prediacte ON statement (subject, predicate)
CREATE INDEX index_subject_object ON statement (subject, object)
CREATE INDEX index_predicate_object ON statement (predicate, object)

Reasons:
This will create index on the following columns: | After creating the indexes, the following queries would run faster 
1) subject                                       | ?city dbo:populationTotal "812231". 
2) predicate                                     | dbr:Edmonton ?relation "812231". 
3) object                                        | dbr:Edmonton dbo:populationTotal ?population. 
4) subject, predicate                            | ?city ?relation "812231". 
5) subject, object                               | ?city dbo:populationTotal ?population. 
6) predicate, object                             | dbr:Edmonton ?realtion ?population. 
As the index will save I/O cost and faster the querying speed, it is needed for rdf database.
In the short run, when the database is not very large, for example, in Edmonton.txt, the index would not take great effect.
However, when the database is growing larger, the 6 indexes are extremely helpful to faster the query speed.
